# Sempress Child

*I don't use the Sempress theme anymore, this repo has been archived*

Sempress Child is a [child theme for WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) that I created for personal use. 
It is based on the [highly semantic](https://indieweb.org/Semantic_HTML) [Sempress Template](https://wordpress.org/themes/sempress/).
