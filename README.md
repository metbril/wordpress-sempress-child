# Sempress Child

Sempress Child is a [child theme for WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) that I created for personal use. 
It is based on the [highly semantic](https://indieweb.org/Semantic_HTML) [Sempress Template](https://wordpress.org/themes/sempress/).

## Notes

This theme requires that commit https://github.com/pfefferle/SemPress/commit/c6ffec09b1a4de67489d5db381f1429d4745f461 has been added to the parent theme.
